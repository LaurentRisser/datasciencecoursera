CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that Laurent performed to clean up the data

run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:

Step 1 : Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Step 2 : Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Step 3 : Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Step 4 : Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

Step 5 : From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
